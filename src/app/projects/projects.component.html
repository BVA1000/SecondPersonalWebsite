                <p>So far I have been working on small projects like this personal website, where I have been utilizing
                    these languages, front-end framework, and database technologies such as:

                <ul>
                    <li>HTML, CSS, & JavaScript</li>

                    <li>Angular & React</li>
                    <li>MySQL</li>
                    <li>Express & Node.js</li>

            <div>
                <p class="github">Most of my project code is stored on my GitHub repositories. I like GitHub a lot due
                    to the fact that
                    you can store and create
                    records of code. Just in case your project happens to crash, you can restore the last code that you
                    saved that is functional.
                    Definitely recommend it especially when you need the code that actually worked.

            <div>
                <p class="pro">There are several starter projects that I have worked on where I was able to apply my
                    knowledge in what I have learned
                    about building applications. My first personal website was a start. This was a one page simple HTML,
                    CSS, & JavaScript
                    application. I did use Bootstrap to enhance the styling of the webpage as you can see in this photo
                    turned out to be fun and interesting.

            <div>
                <p class="postit">This was one of my interesting projects. With this project I was mostly working with
                    Express and JavaScript, the purpose of
                    this project was to learn how to work on the backend. It is a text messaging application, and what
                    is really cool about this application is
                    that it actually can create new users, has a functional login and logout, you can post messages, and
                    it is connected to a My SQL Database where it stores the user's information
                    including their posts.

            </div>
            <div>
                <p class="statetax">Something that is more simple is this application. I was inspired by this idea when
                    I
                    was moving to Montata several months ago. It is called State Tax Information, and is a simple HTML
                    and CSS
                    application with a main page which includes links to all fifty states in the United States with tax
                    rate
                    information for each state. The idea behind this was to create a simple application where the user
                    can see
                    which state is the best option for them in terms of tax savings.

            <div>
                <p class="statetax">As you can see in the next photo when you click on one of the anchor tag links, like
                    Texas,
                    you will see four taxt categories: State Individual Income Tax Rate, Corporate Income Tax Rate,
                    Sales Tax
                    Rate, and Property Tax Rate. When it comes to doing research on state tax rates, these are the four
                    main
                    categories that are most important when determining the states with the lowest and highest tax
                    rates.

            </div>

            <div>
                <p class="statetax">I created this application without the knowledge of frontend frameworks such as
                    React and Angular,
                    so there is not much to it. If I have spare time I will add images and some JavaScript functionality
                    so that it
                    is not just HTML and CSS, but it was just a quck and easy project I did in my spare time.
