                <p>So far I have been working on small projects like this personal website, where I have been utilizing
                    these languages, front-end framework, and database technologies such as:

                <p class="github">Most of my project code is stored on my GitHub repositories. I like GitHub a lot due
                    to the fact that
                    you can store and create
                    records of code. Just in case your project happens to crash, you can restore the last code that you
                    saved that is functional.
                    Definitely recommend it especially when you need the code that actually worked.

                <p class="pro">There are several starter projects that I have worked on where I was able to apply my
                    knowledge in what I have learned
                    about building applications. My first personal website was a start. This was a one page simple HTML,
                    CSS, & JavaScript
                    application. I did use Bootstrap to enhance the styling of the webpage as you can see in this photo
                    turned out to be fun and interesting.

                    Express and JavaScript, the purpose of
                    this project was to learn how to work on the backend. It is a text messaging application, and what
                    is really cool about this application is
                    that it actually can create new users, has a functional login and logout, you can post messages, and
                    it is connected to a My SQL Database where it stores the user's information
                    including their posts.

            <div>
                <p class="statetax">Something that is more simple is this application. I was inspired by this idea when
                    I
                    was moving to Montata several months ago. It is called State Tax Information, and is a simple HTML
                    and CSS
                    application with a main page which includes links to all fifty states in the United States with tax
                    rate
                    information for each state. The idea behind this was to create a simple application where the user
                    can see
                    which state is the best option for them in terms of tax savings.

            <div>
                <p class="statetax">As you can see in the next photo when you click on one of the anchor tag links, like
                    Texas,
                    you will see four taxt categories: State Individual Income Tax Rate, Corporate Income Tax Rate,
                    Sales Tax
                    Rate, and Property Tax Rate. When it comes to doing research on state tax rates, these are the four
                    main
                    categories that are most important when determining the states with the lowest and highest tax
                    rates.

            <div>
                <p class="statetax">I created this application without the knowledge of frontend frameworks such as
                    React and Angular,
                    so there is not much to it. If I have spare time I will add images and some JavaScript functionality
                    so that it
                    is not just HTML and CSS, but it was just a quck and easy project I did in my spare time.

                <h2>Ionic Book App</h2>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class="ionic">For me I would say this is one of the most fun projects that I have worked on. One of
                    the reasons being is I learned
                    how to integrate Ionic and Cordova into an Angular project. What is so great about Ionic and Cordova
                    is that they are UI frameworks
                    which are used for building high quality mobile and desktop apps. So with this project I was able to
                    make it where all sorts of
                    not only have a layout for the desktop user, but also have one for the mobile user. Let's go have a
                    look at it.

                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm">
                <img class="center" id="IONIC" src="../../assets/images/ionic-mobile.png">
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm">
                <img class="center" id="IONIC" src="../../assets/images/ionic-mobile-toc.png">
            </div>

            <div>
                <p class="ionic">The idea behind the project was to create a photo book application which would include
                    pictures of my most favorite photos that I have taken with my iPhone camera and would also include
                    a short story about them. On the left is the photo of what the "Home" page looks like for the
                    album.
                    It is simple with a title and subtitle, the intro photograph, the "Next" button, and has a good
                    mobile look to it. On
                    the right is the photo of the "Table Of Contents".
                    This page has a list of seven pages for the album, which are links that are utilized by a TypeScript
                    function that stores routes to every page so that when the user clicks on a section or page in the
                    "Table Of Contents", it directs them to that exact page that the user wants to view.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm">

            <div class="col-sm">
                <img class="center" id="IONIC" src="../../assets/images/ionic-mobile-pg3v2.png">
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class="ionic">The next two photos display one of the pages to the album. For the first photo to the
                    left it has the page number on the top left. Then there is the title and subtitle, the photograph,
                    and the description of the work. Once the user scrolls down the page, on the second photo to the
                    right, is displayed the "Table Of Contents" and the "Back" and "Next" buttons. What I thoght would
                    be good besides just creating basic navigation for pages was to also include for the user an option
                    to go back to the "Table Of Contents". What this button does is it redirects the user back to the
                    "Table Of Contents" page where the user can choose the desired page that they would like to be
                    directed to. Every page, except for the "Home" and "Table Of Contents" page has this navigation
                    system.

            <div>
                <p class="ionic">The photo above is the desktop version of the "Home" page. This was a fun and
                    interestion
                    project for me.
                    Even though it is just a start to my knowledge of creating a good format for multiple devices, I am
                    happy with
                    my results.
