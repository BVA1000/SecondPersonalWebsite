                <p class="design">One of my most favorite things about programming is the design element. I love the
                    design part of
                    every coding project that I have done because this is where I get to experiment and be creative. As
                    my father always
                    told me "Great Presentation is the key to Success!", and this is very true. I am still learning
                    more, but designing
                    a project from the color of the background to the style of the buttons, makes me feel like I am an
                    artist. To me building an application is like painting a great work of art. Both take time and
                    effort.

                <p class="design">Here is an image of a single page application focused solely on design. I used
                    Bootstrap to design this
                    page and it is my favorite library to use when building applications.
